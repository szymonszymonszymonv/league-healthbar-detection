# league-healthbar-detection
attempt at using python/openCV to detect health bars from an in-game screenshot

## How it works
I use OpenCV to apply masks and transform the image and then I use contour detecting methods to find all rectangles of a particular size that resemble a health bar. \
Works only on spectator mode screenshots.

## Example screens:
Input:

Output: 
HEALTH BARS DETECTED ON SCREEN: 4
